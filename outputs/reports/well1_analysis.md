## Predictive Analysis

### ML Model Performance

A machine learning model was trained to predict pump failures.

*Model metrics are available in `models/trained_models/Well 1/metrics.txt`*

## Recommendations

### 1. Monitoring Frequency
- **Current Status:** Critical - Monitor **hourly**
- Increase monitoring frequency to detect rapid changes

### 2. Early Warning Thresholds
Set alerts at 50% of tolerance limits to enable earlier intervention:

- **Flow** (Mandatory): Alert at +5.0%
- **Head** (Mandatory): Alert at +3.0%

### 3. Maintenance Actions
Based on current status:

- Schedule inspection **immediately**
- Prepare for potential pump replacement
- Investigate root cause of degradation

### 4. Data Collection
To improve future predictions:

- Continue collecting all sensor data
- Document all maintenance activities
- Record environmental conditions (temperature, etc.)
- Track failure modes when they occur

## Conclusion

This analysis of Well 1 provides insights into pump performance and degradation patterns. Continue monitoring and follow the recommendations above to optimize pump reliability.
