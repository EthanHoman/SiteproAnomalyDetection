Set alerts at 50% of tolerance limits to enable earlier intervention:

- **Flow** (Mandatory): Alert at +5.0%
- **Head** (Mandatory): Alert at +3.0%

### 3. Maintenance Actions
Based on current status:

- Continue scheduled maintenance
- No immediate action required

### 4. Data Collection
To improve future predictions:

- Continue collecting all sensor data
- Document all maintenance activities
- Record environmental conditions (temperature, etc.)
- Track failure modes when they occur

## Conclusion

This analysis of Pump 47366 provides insights into pump performance and degradation patterns. Continue monitoring and follow the recommendations above to optimize pump reliability.
